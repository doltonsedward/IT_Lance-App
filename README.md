<br>
IT Lance is a place for job seekers with a light and unique look. come up with an exciting new style. I created this project initially because I wanted to build a startup but for one or two things I ended up switching to a regular open source project




<br>

## Tool i use

1. Inkscape (To create UX and UI design patterns)
2. VsCode (Of course we need this one as programmer)


<br>

## Notes:

> This project is open source, anyone can contribute. just at least create a new branch for me to manage.
